# Overview

For this little side project, I wanted to mess around with parallax scrolling, but as an art form. I had seen several videos of super cool web pages that use parallax scroll so I wanted to try it out. I learn that this specific type of parallax scroll, while it looks very pretty is less practical because it is not very size responsive.

# Development Environment

I did a demo in regular vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and then i also did it in svelte which was mostly the same except the scripting was different.
